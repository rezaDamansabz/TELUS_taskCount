# TELUS_taskCount
The online data analyst at TELUS pays based on the tasks and the allocated time for them. The script will scrap the net to find out my task counts, then calculate the payment and shows it. It requires to login to the account, and it searches the task count tab. This project is written in jupyter notebook, and it's still in progress.
